## Steps:

Step 1:
> Heat the oven to 450 degrees. 

Step 2
> In a small bowl prepare chicken dry brine: mix 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp paprika, and 1 tsp salt. In a large bowl, pour brine over chicken thighs and kabocha squash, set aside. You can just mix this all in one bowl, but I found the paprika and salt didn’t get distributed very well and wished I had mixed it with the olive oil first. I wound up rubbing a bit of extra salt into each of the thighs individually and rubbing everything down individually to try to get the paprika spread about. 

Step 3
> Place the onions, 2 garlic cloves, 2 tbsp oil, 2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp salt in a 9x13 baking dish and mix to combine. Roast for 10 minutes, stirring halfway, until the onions are lightly colored. 

Step 4
> Stir in the lentils, chicken stock, and 1 cup of water. Arrange the squash wedges and the chicken, skin-side up, on top and roast for another 20 minutes, until the skin is deeply golden. 

Step 5
> Turn the oven down to 350 and cook for another 40 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the squash is nicely softened.

Step 6
> Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the sour cream, chives and dill; set aside.

Step 7
> To make the daqa, mix 1 garlic clove, minced, 1/2 tsp cumin, vinegar, sugar, ¼ teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons of water.

Step 8
> When ready, remove the bake from the oven and top with spoonfuls of the sour cream mixture. Pour over the daqa and sprinkle with the extra dill. Serve hot, straight out of the baking dish.
