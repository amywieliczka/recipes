# White Bean Soup

https://www.feastingathome.com/ribollita-recipe/

## Ingredients

1/8 cup good olive oil
1/2 cup chopped pancetta or bacon –optional (feel free to leave this out, or sub vegan bacon)
2 cups diced onions
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced fennel bulb (or sub celery)
4–6 cloves garlic - rough chopped
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, more to taste
2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste
2–3 medium tomatoes – diced (or a 14-ounce can diced tomatoes)
6 cups lacinato (dino) kale, chopped
Splash white wine
6 cups chicken or veggie stock
Parmesan rind (optional, but adds depth and flavor)
3 cups cooked cannellini beans – or use 2 cans cannellini beans (drained, rinsed), or great northern white beans

### Garnish
1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
Grated pecorino or Parmesan – optional or try vegan parmesan
Crusty Bread

### Rosemary Lemon Garlic Oil ( for drizzling) 

1/2 cup good olive oil
zest of one large lemon
4 cloves garlic, sliced
few sprigs rosemary (or thyme, sage)

## Instructions

1. Make the Lemon Garlic Rosemary Oil – place all ingredients in a small jar or bowl and let sit on the counter (or make the day before, refrigerating)
2. In a large, heavy-bottom pot or dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and optional pancetta and saute 6-8 minutes.
3. Lower heat to med-low and add the carrots, fennel (or celery) and garlic, salt, pepper and chili flakes, and cook another 7- 9 minutes until vegetables are tender.
4. Add the tomatoes and lacinato kale, and a splash of white wine, and continue sauteing and stirring occasionally for 7-8 minutes.
5. Add the stock and beans. Bring to soup to boil, turn heat down and simmer for 15 minutes.(You could add a Parmesan rind to the simmering soup for extra depth of flavor.)
6. Stir in fresh Italian Parsley. Adjust salt if necessary.
7. Serve in bowls with a drizzle of the flavorful lemon oil, grated Parmesan ( or Romano) and crusty bread.

### Notes
- If you like a thicker soup, blend or puree 1-2 cups of the soup, and add back to the soup. Or, thicken it with day-old bread, torn into small pieces and cooked with the broth. This is the traditional way. (I prefer a brothier version of this soup, so I skip both and serve with toasty bread on the side instead.)
- Keep this vegan by using veggie broth, no pancetta or parmesan. The rosemary oil will add a delicious flavor – I highly recommend it. Sometimes I’ll add a tablespoon of Nutritional Yeast for a more cheesy flavor and 1 tablespoon miso paste to add more depth. Up to you.
