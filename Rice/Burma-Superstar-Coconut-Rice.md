Dress up for dessert with slices of mango and a drizzle of condensed milk. 

Leave out the sugar and reduce the salt to a pinch for unsweetened rice. 

For the most aromatic rice, use virgin coconut oil instead of refined coconut oil. 

## Ingredients

4 servings:
1 1/2 cups jasmine rice
1 cup coconut milk, well-stirred if separated
1 cup water, minus 1 tbsp if using a rice cooker
2 tbsp white sugar or chopped palm sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp virgin coconut oil

6 servings:
2 cups jasmine rice
1 1/2 cups coconut milk, well-stirred if separated
1 1/2 cups water, minus 2 tbsp if using a rice cooker
2 1/4 tbsp white sugar or chopped palm sugar
1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp virgin coconut oil

## Instructions

Wash the rice well in fresh changes of water, draining through a fine-mesh strainer after each wash until the water runs nearly clear, 3 to 4 washes. After the final wash, let the rice drain in the strainer for at least 15 minutes to allow the excess water to drip off. (The rice will dry faster if you place the strainer over a pot and turn the heat on for a minute.)

While the rice drains, combine the coconut milk and water in a 1-quart liquid measuring cup, using the corresponding amount of liquid for the chosen cooking method. 

Stovetop: Empty the strainer of rice into a pot. Brifely mix in the sugar, salt, and coconut oil, taking care not to break up the kernels. Pour in the coconut milk and water. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. When the lid starts to rattle, remove the lid and give the rice a stir. Cover the pot and decrease the heat to the lowest setting. Cook for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes. This allows the rice to continue to absorb the liquid. Fluff with a fork before serving. 

Rice Cooker: Put the rice in the rice cooker. Briefly mix in the sugar, salt, and coconut oil, taking care not to break up the kernels. Pour in the coconut milk and water. Cook on the white rice setting. When the rice is finished, let it continue to steam in the cooker, ideally for 20 minutes, to allow the kernels to absorb all of the liquid. Fluff with a fork before serving.
